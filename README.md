## Preparation
We recommend the [latest Docker version](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). For simple system integration and supervision we suggest [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). If you're using MacOS or Windows as host operating system, you may take the advantage of [Docker Machine](https://www.docker.com/docker-machine) for Docker's VM management. Confluence requires a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, so we'll provide a specific Docker Compose configuration file to showcase both a Confluence-MySQL link and a data-container feature configuration. Use the installation guides of provided links down below to comply your Docker preparation process.
